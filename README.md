# Buckshot Roulette: Python Practice „Software”

Version 1.1β - “burner phone edition”

⸻

❗ DISCLAIMER

Hi. Still me. Still vibing. Still not a real software engineer.

This weird, mathy, probably inefficient piece of Python is a late-night coding experiment by someone figuring things out one Fraction at a time. If you’re here expecting clean code or scalable architecture… why. Just why.

This is messy. It’s extra. It’s held together by vibes, curiosity, and a Burner Phone. If it works, cool. If it crashes your imaginary game night, that’s also kinda the point? Don’t be mad (╥﹏╥)

So yeah: chaos, jokes, math, and bullets (fake ones). Proceed accordingly.

💡 What This Project Actually Is

It’s a cartridge probability tracker for the game Buckshot Roulette.
Basically:
	•	🎯 Track how many blanks/full shots are left in your revolver (← don’t quote me on firearm terms, I know nothing about guns 火器に付いてマジでなんも知らん).
	•	🧮 Real-time math on your odds every time a shot is taken.
	•	🎞️ Visual display of the current cartridge.
	•	🔮 Burner Phone mode lets you simulate cryptic bullet predictions.
	•	🎭 Dramatic flair, sassy outputs, and random Japanese phrases included for flavor.

This isn’t a game engine—there’s no winning or losing logic. Just you, the bullets, and your questionable life choices.

⚙️ How It Works

The main loop runs automatically. Here’s what goes down:
	1.	📦 You input how many blanks and full shots to load.
	2.	🎨 The cartridge is displayed visually. ([B][F][F]… etc.)
	3.	📊 Probabilities of drawing blanks/full are calculated using Fraction (because decimals are filthy liars: 10進数信じたらアカンわ〜).
	4.	🔫 Every time you “fire” a round, you log whether it was blank (B) or full (F), and the cartridge + stats update instantly.
	5.	📱 Optional: invoke the mysterious Burner Phone, which offers odd advice or forced fate twists.
	6.	🚪 When you run out of rounds, the program exits with a slightly passive-aggressive goodbye.

☎️ About the Burner Phone™

A mischievous feature that:
	•	Lets you simulate external “intel” on what’s coming next.
	•	Can override cartridge data with dramatic flair.
	•	Comes with its own rules, contradictions, and TODOs because life is messy.

Yes, it’s confusing. That’s the point. Suffer beautifully.

⸻

📓 Notes
	•	Built with Python 3 and Fraction because trust in decimals was lost early on.
	•	No GUI. No fancy visuals. Just pure uncut console output energy.
	•	Cartridge display updates dynamically, and changes style based on what’s left.
	•	Some variables and functions have names that make sense only at 2AM. Respect the chaos.

⸻

🧪 Future Features (Maybe)
	•	All usable game objects.
	•	GUI mode with buttons and maybe animations (don’t bet on it).
	•	Fix burner_phone contradictions (currently: a mess).
	•	Support for localization (cuz I’m a language nerd).
	•	More useful error handling (lol).
	•	Clean, smart code (delusional optimism moment).

🎤 Final Thoughts

If you’re using this, thank you. If you broke it, congrats.
This is not a product—it’s a digital diary of me trying to think like a coder.

“Software” ends here.
Cue dramatic reverb effect.
