# Buckshot Roulette: Python Practice „Software” Version 1.0α

# DISCLAIMER:
Hi. I’m just a stupid girl who decided to start coding in her 20s (late bloomer vibes, I’ll probably never be good).
This weird lil’ Python project is nothing more than a messy, exaggeratedly redundant, and probably inefficient exercise. Please don’t be mad at it(◞‸◟). It’s just me figuring out how to think like a programmer.

If you’re looking at the code and asking “why would she write it like this?”—the answer is most likely: I had no idea what I was doing, but I was having fun. And that’s the point.

This “software” was made for laughs, chaos, and a bit(too much) of mathematical curiosity(and a bored autistic mind at work :З).

So if you run it and it breaks your play or confuses you: that’s fair.
But don’t abuse this „software”, okay?
And if your friends ask you not to play with it, maybe listen to them. Or don’t. I’m not your mom.

What This Project Is

This is a mini Python What This Project Actually Is

This script helps you:
	•	Track how many blank and full rounds are left in your (what is believe being a )revolver(火器に付いてマジでなんも知らんねん) during the game.
	•	Visually display the “cartridge” and how it changes as you use bullets.
	•	Keep a running probability calculation for each type of shot remaining.
	•	Update the cartridge every time someone fires(or drink the Soda), and recalculate everything instantly.

It’s like a little sidekick during the game.
A weird Python-made assistant that watches the bullets with you and says:
“Hey… you’ve got a 33.3% chance this next one’s a full shot, there are 2 blanks left . Good luck, I guess?”

This is not a real game—there’s no randomizer or opponent or game logic like win/lose.
It’s more of a… dramatic bullet management interface for the game Buckshot roulette.

How It Works

The script has one big function: parte1(). (Parte = part in Italian)

Inside it:
	•	You start by inputting the number of blank and full bullets.
	•	The code prints out the total and displays a visual cartridge ([X][X][X]...).
	•	It calculates and shows the exact probabilities of drawing a blank or a full shot.
	•	Then, in a little dramatic twist, it lets you “fire” bullets (one at a time) by telling it whether it was a blank (B) or full (F).
	•	It updates the visuals, stats, and probability accordingly.
	•	If the cartridge runs out, the program ends with a sassy goodbye.

There’s also some random Japanese and semi-serious jokes thrown in because why not.

⸻

Notes
	•	The code uses Fraction for precise probabilities (because decimals are liars 10進数信じたらアカンわ〜　-_-b ).
	•	The visual cartridge changes depending on whether only blanks or only fulls are left.
	•	There are planned placeholders for more features, but they don’t exist yet. Sorry, maybe in v2.0? Chissà 
	•	Yes, the variable names are a mess. I was vibing, not engineering.

⸻

Future Plans?

Maybe add:
	•	Every usable object.
	•	More GUI-like UI.
	•	option to says(you didn’t paid attention to the kind of used bullet .
	•	Cleaner, smarter code… one day(don’t believe in it too much草).
     •     Localised versions (I’m a language nerd)

Final Thoughts🧐

If you came here expecting serious software, that’s on you.
This is a baby project by a baby coder.
It took me days. Show some respect. Or buy me a coffee(or a game on steam)[Steam Wishlist] [buymeacoffe] 

Anyway… thanks for playing with my weird brainchild.

„Software“ ends here.
